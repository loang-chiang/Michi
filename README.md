# Michi

A silly, cat-themed Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I was inspired to do this project when thinking about how, in Spanish, both the name for Tic-Tac-Toe and the affectionate nickname for cats are one and the same: michi! 

The game begins with a menu asking the user to choose a name for the first and second player. These names cannot match and they must each be between 1 and 9 characters. But don't worry about these rules: if the names are invalid a message will appear to remind you of them.

Once the game is set, you can click the play button and the fun will begin! The first player's icon is a ginger cat, whereas the second player's is a brown paw (fun fact: the color scheme of the web app is inspired by the color pattern of calico cats!). Hovering over any of the squares will show the icon of the player whose turn it currently is, and the icon can be placed by clicking on the square.

You already know the rules for this game: the first player who gets three of their icon in a row, column, or diagonal line wins! Once this happens (or if there's a tie) another dialog will appear telling you the outcome of the game and giving you two options: to play another round or to restart the game. Choosing to play another round will restart the board and update the number of points of each player, whereas starting a new game will restart all point back to zero and ask you to re-enter names for each player.

Thanks for reading, and hope you have a pawsome (sorry, I couldn't help myself) time playing michi!
